# Markov-Sentence-Generator
Project in progress

This sentence generator will be using a Markov Chain to create new sentences from the book "Tao te Ching".
I will be using a matrix to determine the frequency of words that follow other words most commonly. Eventually I would
like to incorporate a second philosophy text. This should be interesting as another text would bring forth a new philosophy.

*Most of these sentences sound quite incoherent. With a larger text i'd be able to make more sense. I'm thinking of using Proverbs from the Bible or possibly Siddhartha.
